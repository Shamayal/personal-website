            Previously, I worked in a research lab dedicated to enhancing the
            user experience. This position instilled in me a deep understanding
            of the importance of creating user-friendly interfaces, optimizing
            website performance, and adhering to best practices in web
            accessibility standards. I can bring this perspective to my work as
            a web developer, as I believe technology can improve people's lives.
