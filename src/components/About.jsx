            Hello World! I'm Shamayal Syed, a Toronto-based software developer
            with a passion for creating impactful user-friendly experiences
            through coding and accessibility. My journey began as a qualitative
            researcher at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, where I delved
            into making technology accessible to people with dementia.
          </p>
          <p className="montserrat-600-font">
            My diverse background includes a short period working in the dynamic
            insurance industry which honed my ability to quickly grasp new
            technologies, frameworks, and programming languages â€“ a crucial
            skill in the evolving field of web development.
          </p>
          <p className="montserrat-600-font">
            Now as a junior developer, I apply my analytical skills and
            problem-solving abilities to create innovative solutions. I am
            actively committed to advancing my skills and expanding my knowledge
            on my career in software development.
          </p>

          <p className="montserrat-600-font">
            In my free time, I indulge in baking pastries, and other confections
