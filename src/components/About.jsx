            Hello World! I'm Shamayal Syed, a Toronto-based full-stack web
            developer. My journey began as a student researcher at the Toronto
            Rehabilitation Institute, where I focused on making technology
            accessible to people with dementia, I'm passionate about merging my
            coding skills with web accessibility principles to create impactful,
            user-friendly experiences across websites and applications.

            development. My diverse background fosters adaptability, enabling me
