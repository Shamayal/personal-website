            Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shamayal Syed, a Toronto-based software developer
            with a background in Human and Cell Biology.

          <p className="montserrat-600-font">
            At the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, I studied the impacts of technology on people with dementia. This experience reignited my interest in coding and motivated me to improve my skills so I can contribute to projects that apply web accessibility principles to create impactful, user-friendly experiences across websites and applications.

          <p className="montserrat-600-font">
            As a Junior Developer, I'm eager to embrace new challenges and committed to being a lifelong learner. By continuously expanding my skill set, I aim to apply my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities to create innovative solutions, contribute effectively to team objectives, and grow in my tech career.
